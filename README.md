# arduinopromreader
Arduino sketch to dump a TMS2532 EPROM and output to serial port in Intel Hex format

Pretty much as the description states. I needed to dump a 2532 from an old piece of hardware
and this seemed the cheapest way to do it, plus I learnt how to do a simple job with
Arduino.

I used a Mega clone just so I didn't have to worry about number of pins, but it only needs 20, so
it may be OK with an Uno assuming there are no restrictions on the pin usage.
